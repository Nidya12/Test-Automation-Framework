
# Test Automation Framework

## Overview

This test automation framework is designed to streamline UI testing for web applications. It uses Java 11, TestNG, and Selenium WebDriver for efficient and scalable testing. It also integrates Apache POI, OpenCSV, Gson, and Faker for data-driven testing and data generation. Cloud-based test execution is achieved using LambdaTest, and tests can be run locally or on the cloud using Maven commands.
